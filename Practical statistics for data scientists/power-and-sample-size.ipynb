How many clicks do you need\nto accumulate in the study? If you are interested only in results that show a huge dif‐\nference (say, a 50% difference), a relatively small sample might do the trick. If, on the\nother hand, even a minor difference would be of interest, then a much larger sample\nis needed. A standard approach is to establish a policy that a new ad must do better\nthan an existing ad by some percentage, say, 10%; otherwise, the existing ad will\nremain in place. This goal, the “effect size,” then drives the sample size.\n\nFor example, suppose current click-through rates are about 1.1%, and you are seeking\na 10% boost to 1.21%. So we have two boxes: box A with 1.1% ones (say, 110 ones and\n9,890 zeros), and box B with 1.21% ones (say, 121 ones and 9,879 zeros). For starters,\nlet’s try 300 draws from each box (this would be like 300 “impressions” for each ad).\n\nSuppose our first draw yields the following:\nBox A: 3 ones\nBox B: 5 ones","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Right away we can see that any hypothesis test would reveal this difference (5 versus\n3) to be well within the range of chance variation. This combination of sample size\n(n = 300 in each group) and effect size (10% difference) is too small for any hypothe‐\nsis test to reliably show a difference.\nSo we can try increasing the sample size (let’s try 2,000 impressions), and require a\nlarger improvement (50% instead of 10%).\n\nFor example, suppose current click-through rates are still 1.1%, but we are now seek‐\ning a 50% boost to 1.65%. So we have two boxes: box A still with 1.1% ones (say, 110\nones and 9,890 zeros), and box B with 1.65% ones (say, 165 ones and 9,868 zeros).\n\nNow we’ll try 2,000 draws from each box. Suppose our first draw yields the following:\nBox A: 19 ones\nBox B: 34 ones\n\nA significance test on this difference (34–19) shows it still registers as “not signifi‐\ncant” (though much closer to significance than the earlier difference of 5–3). To cal‐\nculate power, we would need to repeat the previous procedure many times, or use\nstatistical software that can calculate power, but our initial draw suggests to us that\neven detecting a 50% improvement will require several thousand ad impressions.\n\nIn summary, for calculating power or required sample size, there are four moving\nparts:\n• Sample size\n• Effect size you want to detect\n• Significance level (alpha) at which the test will be conducted\n• Power\n\nSpecify any three of them, and the fourth can be calculated. Most commonly, you\nwould want to calculate sample size, so you must specify the other three. W","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Procedure \n\nHere’s a fairly intuitive approach:\n\n1. Start with some hypothetical data that represents your best guess about the data\nthat will result (perhaps based on prior data)—for example, a box with 20 ones\nand 80 zeros to represent a .200 hitter, or a box with some observations of “time\nspent on website.”\n2. Create a second sample simply by adding the desired effect size to the first sam‐\nple—for example, a second box with 33 ones and 67 zeros, or a second box with\n25 seconds added to each initial “time spent on website.”\n3. Draw a bootstrap sample of size n from each box.\n4. Conduct a permutation (or formula-based) hypothesis test on the two bootstrap\nsamples and record whether the difference between them is statistically\nsignificant.\n5. Repeat the preceding two steps many times and determine how often the differ‐\nence was significant—that’s the estimated power.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from scipy import stats\nimport statsmodels.api as sm \nfrom statsmodels.stats import power ","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-17T16:37:16.292996Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-17T16:37:16.293427Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-17T16:37:18.324519Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-17T16:37:16.293391Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-17T16:37:18.323506Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# To find the sample size with 10% boost from 1.1% to 1.21%\n\neffect_size = sm.stats.proportion_effectsize(0.0121,0.011)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-17T16:45:35.622092Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-17T16:45:35.622518Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-17T16:45:35.628084Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-17T16:45:35.622483Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-17T16:45:35.626949Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":31,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"effect_size","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-17T16:44:56.980168Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-17T16:44:56.980551Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-17T16:44:56.987181Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-17T16:44:56.980522Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-17T16:44:56.986309Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":27,"outputs":[{"execution_count":27,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"0.01029785095103608"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Statistical Power calculations for t-test for two independent sample\n\nanalysis = sm.stats.TTestIndPower()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-17T16:44:57.994661Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-17T16:44:57.995091Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-17T16:44:58.000913Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-17T16:44:57.995053Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-17T16:44:57.999732Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":28,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"result = analysis.solve_power(effect_size = effect_size,alpha = 0.05,power = 0.8,alternative = 'larger')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-17T16:44:58.637735Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-17T16:44:58.638355Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-17T16:44:58.649487Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-17T16:44:58.638312Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-17T16:44:58.648451Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":29,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(f'Sample size %.3f',result)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-17T16:44:59.398403Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-17T16:44:59.398824Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-17T16:44:59.404846Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-17T16:44:59.398790Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-17T16:44:59.403514Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":30,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Sample size %.3f 116602.39259746042\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**This says we need atleast 11k samples to get 80% power**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"effect_size = sm.stats.proportion_effectsize(0.0165, 0.011)\nanalysis = sm.stats.TTestIndPower()\nresult = analysis.solve_power(effect_size=effect_size, \n                              alpha=0.05, power=0.8, alternative='larger')\nprint('Sample Size: %.3f' % result)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-17T16:45:39.894669Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-17T16:45:39.895120Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-17T16:45:39.908632Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-17T16:45:39.895088Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-17T16:45:39.907202Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":32,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Sample Size: 5488.408\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### If we increase the effect size to 50% to boost to 1.65%, we need a smaller sample as the difference is small ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We see that if we want a power of 80%, we\nrequire a sample size of almost 120,000 impressions.
